        "The ridge regression is a variant of the linear regression that is used to prevent multicolinearity coming from the covariables in the dataset and thus prevent overfitting. In fact, when the features are correlated, the matrix $X^TX$ is not invertible and the least square solution is not unique. Hence, the ridge regression is used to stabilize the solution by adding a L2 penalty term to the loss function. It's the reason wwhy the ridge regression is also called a L2 regularization.\n",
